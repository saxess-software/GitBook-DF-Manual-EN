# The New Web Client

With the Excel client you have undertaken the modelling of your DataFactory processes, and the structures, methods and data that belong to these have been saved to your database. Any other users that have access to the Excel client are able to connect with your database and retrieve, edit or delete these structures, methods and data.

Some users may not use the Excel software regularly, or may be temporarily unable to access the Excel client on their computers. With the web client, these users have the ability to collect, record and visualize data in DataFactory without the Excel access data.
