### Client

There are two clients with which the information in the database can be accessed. Both clients work simultaneously in the same database with an identical data inventory. 

**Excel Client**  
The Excel client is an Excel portfolio that is compatible with every version of Excel from 2010 onwards. No separate installations or add-ons are required. The Excel client works both in the local intranet and in the Cloud.

Typically, the system designer would use the Excel client. It offers the means to construct, develop and configure the system.

**Web Client**  
The web client can be used in all mainstream browsers. Separate installations or add-ons are not required. Using the web client, it is also possible for the database to access mobile terminals. If the web client is also to be used for a DB in the intranet, it will be necessary to install a webserver \(IIS\) on the server. The web client is most often used by individuals intending to read and enter data, after the system has already been designed.
