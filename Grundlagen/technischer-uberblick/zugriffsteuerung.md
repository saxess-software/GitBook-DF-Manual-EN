### Access Control

DataFactory supports a variety of access control systems.

**Active Directory**  
The active directory is used when DataFactoy is installed on the local server. All intranet users are saved in the active directory. When DataFactory is started, the user is authentificated over the active directory through a log-in on the userâ€™s computer \(single-sign-on\).

**E-Mail Address and Password**  
To access the Cloud, the authentification is managed via e-mail address and password. For this process, it is necessary to register the e-mail address at [www.planning-factory.de](https:\\www.planning-factory.de).
