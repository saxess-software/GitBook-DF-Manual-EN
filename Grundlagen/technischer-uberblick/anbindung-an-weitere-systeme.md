### Connection to further Systems

DataFactory offers the ability to import and export data to and from other systems.

**Manual Connection**  
The manual import of data is the more favourable option when data is imported irregularly. The import can take place using a variety of formats \(e.g. .csv, xlsx, etc.\) 

**Automatic Connection**  
When data is regularly imported, the data stream can be directly connected for automatic import. The connection can be made directly on the database level and allows third parties to access selected databases. 

The data connection is especially convenient when used with the help of SX Integrators.
