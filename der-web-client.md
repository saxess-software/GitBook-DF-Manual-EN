# The Web Client

Using the Excel client, you have performed the modelling of your processes in DataFactory, and the corresponding structures, methods and data have been saved to your database. Other users who have access to the Excel client can connect to your database and load, edit or delete these structures, methods and data.

There may be users who do not regularly use the Excel software, or users who are currently unable to access the Excel client on their computers. These users can use the web client to collect and visualize data in DataFactory without access to the Excel software.
