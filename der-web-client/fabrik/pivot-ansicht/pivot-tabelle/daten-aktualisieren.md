### Updating Data

If you enter a factory and show the pivot table, the current data will always be loaded from the database into the pivot table. If data in DataFactory is updated while you are still in the pivot view, these updates will not immediately be shown in your pivot. In this case, the data must be manually updated.

1\) Right-click in the secondary region of the field list or in the pivot table into which you drag line, column and data fields. A field will open with the **Update Data** option.
