### Pivot Chart

#### _Structure _

The structure of the pivot chart resembles that of the pivot table. This means that all fields defined in the pivot table as line, column and data fields will also be found in the pivot chart. 

| Pivot Table | Corresponding Element in the Pivot Chart |
| --- | --- |
| Line Field | Y-Axis/ Vertical Axis |
| Column Field | X-Axis/ Horizontal Axis |
| Data Field | Graph/ Data Series |
