#### Overview of a Work

After accessing your work in the web client, you will see the **navigation bar**, the **configuration bar **and the **values section**.

You have the option to collapse the navigation bar with the structure tree and use the whole browser window to display the pivot table, or to use the product line or product display.

To do this, click on the small arrow located in the centre of the gray vertical bar.
