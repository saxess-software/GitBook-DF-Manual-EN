### _FlexSearch_

As in the Excel client, FlexSearch utilises an “intelligent search bar”, or a search bar which expands with an automatic list of search suggestions. The list contents vary from product to product, as only content relevant to the selected product is displayed.

1\) Highlight the cells in which you wish to enter a value with the help of FlexSearch and click on the **FlexSearch** icon.
