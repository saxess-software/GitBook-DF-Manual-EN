> **Note:** The formula will only continue to exist as long as the values section is defined as XLS or XLS-Strict in the **Origin** settings. Otherwise, the formula will be replaced by the value when the data is saved.

If you right-click in a cell, you have the option to cut, copy, paste or delete the contents of the cell. Values copied to the clipboard can be pasted into the highlighted cells using the **Paste** option.
