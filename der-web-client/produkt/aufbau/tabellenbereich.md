#### Table Body

The structure and computational logic of the table, having been defined in the Excel client, cannot be changed in the web client. The table contains a values section, a time axis and an axis with the name and ID of the value series.

No changes can be made to the axes themselves. Data can only be collected, changed or deleted within the values section. 

#### _Invisible Time Axis_

In the web client you can also display individual templates and products without a time axis. In this case, only the name and ID of the value series, and the value series itself, will be shown. This is possible with both vertical and horizontal template/product orientations. These templates/products bear the naming conventions **VN** or **HN**.

To activate this display setting, proceed as follows:

1\) Create a template as usual in the Excel client, on a yearly, monthly, or daily basis.

2\) Click on the **Template** column and chang the time-based indicator in the suffix \(**J**, **M** or **T**\) in **N**. Make sure to save your changes.

3\) The template/product will be shown in the web client without the time axis

The template type **VN/HN** can be used if you choose to use a value series, e.g. with individual period designations, instead of the numeric time axis. In combination with the** Fixed Window** option you can allow this value series to be shown as a new, constantly visible time axis.
