## Accessing the Web Client

There are several possible methods for accessing the web client.

### **1\) Via the Excel client**

#### _Option A_

If you use DataFactory in the Cloud version, meaning that your database is located on a Cloud server, the **Web Client** option will be displayed below your cluster in the work overview. By clicking the **Web Client** option, your default web browser will open and you will be navigated to the web view of your work.
