## Authorization

As you learned in the chapter [**User Management**](/der-excel-client/werk/benutzer-verwalten.md), users and their access rights can be comfortably managed within DataFactory. In the Excel client, you define for each user the reading and editing permissions on product line and factory levels. The access rights defined in the Excel client also apply to the web client; therefore, a user who was given editing rights for a particular product line in the Excel client will posses the same editing rights for the same product line in the web client.

You can identify which access rights you possess by means of the font color of factories and product lines in the navigation bar.

If a product line or factory is shown with a black font colour, you have editing permissions for that product line or factory.
