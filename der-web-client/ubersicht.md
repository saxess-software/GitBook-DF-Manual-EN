## Overview

The web client is a web application that can be opened in any kind of web browser. The structures and methods of the web-cleint are based on the structures and methods you have previously developed in the Excel client. The Excel client and the web client access the same database; therefore, you will find all structures and data from the Excel client in the web client as well.

In contrast to the Excel client, you can only collect and visualize data in the web client. This means that you cannot create new factories or product lines. In the web client you can only create and gather data on objects \(products\).

In the following chapter you will learn about all the functions and capabilities of the web client.
