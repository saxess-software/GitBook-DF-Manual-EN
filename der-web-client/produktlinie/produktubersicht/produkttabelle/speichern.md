### Saving

There are two save options on the product line level. You can either:

* Save changes made to the data in the product table
* Save changes made to the layout.

#### Saving Data

After your desired changes have been made to the data in the product table, these changes must be saved by clicking the **Save** button in the toolbar. The changes are then saved in the database. If you leave the product line without saving your changes, all changes will be lost.

> **Note:** If changes have been made to the data and you try to leave the product line without saving, a warning will be displayed reminding you to save your changes so your data is not lost.

#### Saving the Layout

If changes have been made to the layout itself, e.g. hiding columns, grouping etc., you can save these changes to the database by clicking **Save Layout**. The next time you access the product line, the product table will be shown with the new layout.
