### Filtering

By using filters in your product table, you can regulate the number of products shown to you. You have the option to set a filter in each column of your product table.

> **Note: **The filter bar can be rehidden using the same steps. If a filter is applied and the filter bar is then hidden, the filter will remain.

#### _Selecting a Filter from a Drop-Down Menu_

You can now set filters for each single column of the filter bar. If a list for an attribute was deposited in the Excel client, you have the option to select the filter for the column from a drop-down menu. 

1\) Click on the arrow in the column with the drop-down menu and select your desired filter.

2\) The product table now contains all products with the desired filter.

#### _Set a Filter by Manual Entry \(No Menu\)_

In the columns without a drop-down menu, you can select the filter by entering it manually on your keyboard. 

Move the cursor into the column of the filter bar in which you wish to set a filter. You can then enter the keyword or value by which you wish to filter. 

> **Note: **The entered keyword or value must begin with the same letter, number or symbol as the keyword or value that you wish to search by. For example, if you would like to filter by “Commerzbank Leipzig”, your entry must read, for instance, “Comm”. If you enter “Bank” or “Leipzig”, no information will be shown.
