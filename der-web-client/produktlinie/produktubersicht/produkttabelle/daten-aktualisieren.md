### Updating Data

If you access the product line and view the product table, the current data from your database will always be loaded in the product table. If data in DataFactory is updated while you are on the product line, the updated information will not immediately be shown in the product table. The data will then need to be manually updated. 

1\) Right-click on a cell in the product table. A window will open with the **Update** option. Click on this option.
