## Lists and Formats

Lists and formats in DataFactory are centrally managed for each work and can be implemented in all hierarchical levels. Three types of lists exist in DataFactory, each of which is identifiable by a respective prefix.

> **Note:** Lists and formats must always begin with the prefix c.

| Prefix | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **sx** | Saxess | Lists and formats with the prefix “sx” stand for system lists and formats, and are provided by Saxess by default.  |
| **su** | Solution | Lists and formats with the prefix “su” stand for solution lists and formats. These will be delivered as part of individual solutions. |
| **c** | Solution | Lists and formats with the prefix “c” stand for customer lists and format. These can be created and customized by the user. |
