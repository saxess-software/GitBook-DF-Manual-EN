## Evaluating Data

DataFactory offers many options for evaluating data. The option to evaluate data directly over pivot tables and pivot diagrams is implemented in every DataFactory by default. 

Data from DataFactory can also be evaluated using separate **Reporting Portfolios** or by connecting a third system.
