## Installation

The scope of the required installation depends on whether your DataFactory database is to be kept on your own SQL server or whether it is to be hosted on our Cloud server. 

In both cases, the Excel client must first be installed on your system. If you use your own SQL server, additional installation steps in SQL Management Studio will be required. If this is the case, these steps must be carried out by the system administrator.

You will now find yourself in the work overview, where you can establish a connection to your database, as described in the chapter **Connecting works**. Further installation steps are required should you choose to use an SQL server. You can now connect to a database in the Saxess Cloud. 

If you choose to use a DataFactory database stored on your own server, you must ask your system administrator to configure it for you. If you are the system administrator, refer to the chapter **Installation of the DataFactory Database**.
