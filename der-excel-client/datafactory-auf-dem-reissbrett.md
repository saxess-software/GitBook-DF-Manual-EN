## Designing DataFactory on the Drawing Board

It may be beneficial to develop the structure of your DataFactory on paper first, before you start the structuring process in the system. Oftentimes in DataFactory, there are multiple solutions to one problem.

While conceptualizing the design of the system, you may find yourself asking questions such as:

* With what level of granularity do I want to collect my data?
* How do I want to aggregate this data?
* Which data needs to be collected and what values need to be calculated?
* Which user should collect which kind of data \(keyword: Access permissions\)?
* ...

A variety of requirements from a number of user groups influence the design process, so it is easy to lose track. It can therefore be benefical to begin by sketching out on paper the various processes, dependencies and elements required by your specific application. A well-thought-out concept and a concise vision of how the structure should be implemented in DataFactory will save you a considerable amount of time while designing the final solutions in your system.
