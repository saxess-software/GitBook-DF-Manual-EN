Before you can use DataFactory, you will need a database on an MS-SQL server.  If you are storing your DataFactory files on the Cloud server, a database will be automatically provided to you. If you are using DataFactory on your local intranet, the database will need to be created by the database administrator.

In this section you will learn how to access, connect or delete a work.
