## Product

In DataFactory, a product is an object that contains data. Concrete data in a product is recorded by the user. Each product possesses a **ProductID** and a **Product Name**. In combination with the product line and factory it belongs to, a product is precisely identifiable within a work. Each product also possesses a status which can be controlled through a list centrally stored in the work. 

Each product is based on a template from which it is manufactured.
