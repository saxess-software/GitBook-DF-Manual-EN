7\) If desired, an image can be added to the selected tile by clicking the **Add Image** button.

> **Note:** The picture will be saved directly in the connection, so the picture does not need to be kept on your computer. The image file must be a .png file with the dimensions 150 x 100 px.

8\) Click on the **Save** button to save the connection.

9\) After saving, you can close the connection manager to return to the work overview where the new connection to your cluster is shown.
