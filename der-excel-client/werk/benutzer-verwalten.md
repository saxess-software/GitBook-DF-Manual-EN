### User Management

DataFactory offers a comfortable method of managing users and their access rights within DataFactory. User permissions for each work are managed by a central setting. However, it is also possible to grant each user individual access rights on each level down to the product line.

The access rights are organized into **three levels**:

| Level | Right | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Deny | No permissions |
| 2 | Read | Read-only |
| 3 | Write | Reading and editing permissions |

##### Comment Function

Furthermore, you have the option to require other users to leave a comment when they read and/or edit data in your DataFactory, benefitting the documentation and security of your data.

| Setting | Options |
| --- | --- |
| ReadCommentMandatory \(0\) | The user is not required to leave a comment when reading data. |
| ReadCommentMandatory \(1\) | The user must leave a comment when reading data. |
| WriteCommentMandatory \(0\) | The user is not required to leave a comment when editing data. |
| WriteCommentMandatory \(1\) | The user must leave a comment when editing data. |
