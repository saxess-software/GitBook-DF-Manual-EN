> **Note:** Rights in DataFactory will be carried forward. If you wish to grant a user the same rights and required comment settings for the entire work, it is only necessary to edit these properties in the first line. After saving, these settings will be applied to all lines. Access rights to a factory can be edited in the same manner if the user is to have access to all product lines of a factory. To deny all users access rights, execute a Deny in the top level.
