## Templates

Templates are products designed to serve as a blueprint for further products. From a technical point of view, templates are identical to products. All products are either a template or a copy of a template \(or in programming terms, a class or an instance\). A copy is independent from the template after it has been created, so it can be edited as a singular product and will not be changed when the template is edited.

It is recommended to organize thematically connected templates together in one product line, using different product lines for each theme.
