### Sending and Receiving Templates

Templates serve as blueprints for products. The template and the new product may be understood as an original and a copy. After a copy is created, it is independent from the original. This means that it can be changed without changing the template, and that it will not be changed when the template is edited.

With the **Send Templates** and **Receive Templates** functions you have the option to edit templates and pass these changes on to the associated products.

**The following edits will be passed on:**

* Changes in format
* Changes in algorithms and logic
* Changes in visibility levels, data type, origin, scaling and economic effect
* Changes in column width
* Changes in column name and ID
* Changes to the time axis
* Deleted and added columns

> **Note:** Data entered into the product manually will not be deleted or overwritten.

4\) In this function, by default, the columns in the template and in the product will be identified based on the column IDs, and the columns with these same IDs are then compared to each other with regard to the changes. Should you wish to execute the identification process based on the column names, check the box **Compare by Name Instead of ID**.

3.2\) Should you wish to send the template to multiple products, open the drop-down menu from the **Multi** tab. You must then select the factory, product line and template types to which you wish to send the template. 

> **Note:** If one of these fields is left empty, it means that all factories, product lines, or template types will be selected. For example, if you enter “BK-Vertragsverwaltung” as a factory but leave the product line and template fields empty, the template will be applied to all products in all product lines of the factory “BK-Vertragsverwaltung”.
