#### _Calculations Using Global Attributes and IDs_ 

The global attributes defined for a product, as well as factory, product line and product IDs, are available to you in the hidden columns of the template. 

In the following example, global attributes have been assigned to some products. These global attributes, as well as the factory, product line and product ID, are to be made available for further uses as cell values in the template itself.

In the template, the global attributes will be displayed for your information below the comments bar. However, values in this form cannot be used in formulas.

There is another place where the global attributes can be accessed. However, this is not immediately visible in the standard template view, as it is hidden by default. To display the global attributes and the factory, product line and product ID, proceed as follows:

1\) Check the **Titles** box in the **View** tab of the Excel menu bar. The column and row numbers have now been unhidden.

In the **Cell B22** you can find the factory ID, in **Cell B23** the product line ID and in **Cell B24** the product ID. From **Cell B25** onwards, the global attributes will be displayed in vertically decreasing order.
