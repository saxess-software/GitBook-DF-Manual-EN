#### _Adding a Value List_

If you deposit a list for a value series, the entries of this list will be displayed as suggestions for the cell values. This also means that cell values cannot be entered freely, but must be selected from a drop-down menu.

1\) Navigate to the value series to which you wish to assign a list. Open the drop-down menu in the **Value List** row and select your desired list.
