#### _Using an Excel Formula in a Template_

Excel formulas can be used when designing a template.  
To integrate Excel formulas into your template, proceed as follows:

1\) Navigate to the value series in which you wish to use an Excel formula and open the drop-down menu in the row **Origin**.

> **Note:** If you wish to change and overwrite the formula during later data input, select the XLS setting. If you do not wish the formula to be changed or overwritten in the future, select the XLS-Strict setting.

3\) Navigate to the first row of your values section and enter the desired formula.
