#### _Defining the Template/Product View_

When you access a template for the first time, the view settings **Fixed Window** and **Scroll Automatically to Current Date** will be predefined. You can change these settings in the **…-Context** menu in the **Settings** section.

**Scroll Automatically to Current Date**. If it is currently March 2017, the timeline will skip to this month when accessing the template. This means that the first row that is displayed to you in the values section is March 2017, even if your timeline begins in January 2016. If you wish to deactivate this feature, proceed as follows:

1\) In the product, click on the **…-Context** menu.

**Fixed Window Option**  
If you scroll up, down, left or right in the values section, only the title and timeline area will be fixed. However, you can define your view settings in a way that, for example, the first column or the first two columns will be fixed and always displayed in the values section while scrolling.

1\) In the product, click on the **…-Context** menu.
