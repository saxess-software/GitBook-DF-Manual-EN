#### _Changing IDs_

If you create a new template or add a new column into a template, the value series will be automatically assigned Default-IDs. This means that they possess IDs labelled ID1, ID2,â€¦,IDn. You can customize the IDs individually later.

> **Note 1:** Every column within a product or template must possess one unique ID. It is not possible for two columns to carry the same ID. If possible, it is recommended to choose descriptive IDs.
>
> **Note 2:** The assigned ID should consist of at least two characters. This means that value series should not be assigned IDs like M, D or J. The one-character value series IDs are used for specific calculations on the database.

To change the IDs of your value series, proceed as follows:

1\) Click on the ActionLink in the **Action** row in the column of which you wish to change the ID.
